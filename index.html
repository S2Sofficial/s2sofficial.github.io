            applications. His creative side shines through photography and graphic design, where he has contributed to
            university events and personal projects. As a former coding instructor, he enjoys simplifying complex topics
            and making technology accessible to learners. Swaroop’s passion for innovation, combined with his dedication
            to research and development, sets him on a path toward making meaningful contributions in the tech industry.
